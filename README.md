## Build

### Maven

*Pensum* uses [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to build the project. Please use standard Maven commands to build what you need:

| Command          | What it does                                                      |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `./mvnw`         | compile and run the app                                           |
| `./mvnw clean`   | cleanup generated files and build artefacts                       |
| `./mvnw compile` | compile the code without running the tests                        |
| `./mvnw test`    | compile and run all tests                                         |
| `./mvnw package` | compile, test, and create a JAR file to run it with Java directly |
| `./mvnw verify`  | compile, test, package, and run analysis tools                    |

There is *no need* to run the `install` or `deploy` tasks. They will just run longer, produce unnecessary output, burn energy, and occupy your disk space. [Don't just blindly run mvn clean install...](https://www.andreaseisele.com/posts/mvn-clean-install/)

### Docker

*Pensum* comes with a complete dockerized build for production use. It is not recommended to use the self-contained build for development purposes. Please take a look at the section about [Production Build](#production-build) below.

## Running and debugging

### Running from the command line

To run from the command line, run `./mvnw` and open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

### Running and debugging in Intellij IDEA

- Locate the `Application.java` class in the project view. It is in the `src` folder, under the main package's root.
- Right-click on the `Application` class
- Select "Debug 'Application.main()'" from the list

After the server has started, you can view the UI at http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
You can now also attach breakpoints in code for debugging purposes, by clicking next to a line number in any source file.

### Running and debugging in Eclipse

- Locate the `Application.java` class in the package explorer. It is in `src/main/java`, under the main package.
- Right-click on the file and select `Debug As` --> `Java Application`.

Do not worry if the debugger breaks at a `SilentExitException`. This is a Spring Boot feature and happens on every startup.

After the server has started, you can view it at http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
You can now also attach breakpoints in code for debugging purposes, by clicking next to a line number in any source file.

## Configuration

*Pensum* can be started without any specific configuration. All configuration options have working default values. To modify these default values just specify environment variables with the following names:

| Variable | Default | Description                                       |
|----------|---------|---------------------------------------------------|
| TZ       | UTC     | The timezone used for date and time calculations. |

## Production

### Production Build

#### Maven

You can use [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to build *Pensum* for production. Just specify the `production` profile. Example:

```shell
./mvnw clean package -Pproduction
```

#### Docker

To create a production build for *Pensum* it is highly recommended to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/). *Pensum* comes with a complete dockerized self-contained build. You don't need to have Maven or Java installed, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/) is enough. The Docker build file contains everything needed, just start a standard Docker build with the following command:

```shell
docker build -t pensum .
```

This might run for a while and will produce a Docker image tagged `pensum` on your local system.

### Run in Production

It is highly recommended to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/) to run *Pensum* in production. Use the following command line as an example:

```shell
docker run \
    --name pensum \
    -p 80:8080 \
    -e TZ=CET \
    -d \
    --rm \
    mcpringle/pensum
```

Short explanation, consult the Docker or Podman documentation for more information about all available options for running an image.

| Option           | Explanation                                     |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| --name pensum    | Specify the name for the running instance.      |
| -p 80:8080       | Make *Pensum* available on host port 80         |
| -e KEY=value     | Configure *Pensum* using environment variables. |
| -d               | Run *Pensum* in daemon mode (background).       |
| --rm             | Remove the container when stopping *Pensum*.    |
| mcpringle/pensum | The Docker image to be started.                 |

Modify this command according your needs and consult the [configuration section](#configuration) above for more information about how to configure *Pensum*. The Docker image of *Pensum* will be pulled from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) automatically when not available locally.

### GitHub Discussions

We use the corresponding GitHub function for discussions. The discussions held here are long-lived and divided into categories for the sake of clarity. One important category, for example, is that for questions and answers.
